<h1>Home Sales Challenge</h1>

In this challenge, I use sparkSQL to determine some key metrics about home sales data. I utilize my skills to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache temporary tables, and verify that tables remain cached or uncached. 

<h3>Coding Assistance</h3>
I could not remember how to pull certain data from a time-formatted column, so that is the one thing I needed to head to the internet for help with. The URL for my solution is below, as well as commented out in the code where I needed it. Otherwise, I just relied on class materials to finish the rest of the assignment. <br><br>
